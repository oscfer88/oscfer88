### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Lecturer in Cognitive NEuroscience at the University of Surrey (United Kingdom) working in the field of neurophysiology and congnitive psychology. I am interested in attention, predictions and consciousness, as well as open science, programming and data science in general. My work makes uses of advances neuroscientific techniques (EEG, MEG, TMS, eye-tracking) and cutting-edge data analysis methods (machine learning, time-frequency, connectivity, RIFT) to better understand how the human brain and mind work.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- **Neuronal effects of predictions based on statistical learning on visual attention** ([repository](https://github.com/oscfer88/dSL_RIFT))
> What we experienced in the past affects how we perceive the external world in the future. For example, an annoying flashing light might be better ignored if we know in advance where it usually appears. This ability of extracting regularities from the environment is called [statistical learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_in_language_acquisition). In this project, we explore the neuronal mechanisms allowing the attentional system to overlook items that are unequivocally distracting based on their spatial distribution. By recording brain activity using [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography) while probing neural excitability with a novel technique called [rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT)](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhac160), we show that the neuronal excitability in early visual cortex is reduced in advance of stimulus presentation for locations where distracting items are more likely to occur.
- **COGITATE: an adversarial collaboration on the brain correlates of consciousness** ([repository](https://github.com/Cogitate-consortium/cogitate-msp1))
> One of the biggest unresolved questions in neuroscience is the so-called [neural correlates of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlates_of_consciousness): How does a conscious subjective experience, like the pleasant feeling of the sun on the skin, arise from bioelectric signals processed by billions of neurons in the brain? Many theories have been proposed to unravel this mystery, some gathering robust empirical support and leading to clear, testable predictions. However, the lack of crosstalk between theoretical frameworks has produced incompatible models and predictions. The idea behind the [Cogitate consortium](https://www.arc-cogitate.com) is to compare (two of the) leading theories of consciousness by identifying their most diagnostic points of divergence and designing experiments that directly test them. By embracing this [adversarial collaborative framework](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj3259), experiments have been developed with, and endorsed by, the theoriesâ€™ proponents. The first resultsâ€”published in [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08888-1)â€”challenged some of the main assumptions of both theories, suggesting the need for a new integrative theory of consciousness. Beyond challenging existing theories, this project proposes an alternative approach to advancing cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven collaborative research.
- **FLUX: open-source pipeline for analysing magnetoencephalography (MEG) data** ([repository](https://github.com/Neuronal-Oscillations/FLUX))
> MEG allows for quantifying modulations of human neuronal activity on a millisecond time scale while also making it possible to estimate the location of the underlying neuronal sources. The technique relies heavily on signal processing and source modelling. To this end, there are several open-source toolboxes developed by the community. While these toolboxes are powerful as they provide a wealth of options for analyses, the many options also pose a challenge for reproducible research as well as for researchers new to the field. The [FLUX pipeline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922001768?via%3Dihub) aims to make the analyses steps and setting explicit for standard analysis done in cognitive neuroscience. It focuses on quantifying and source localization of oscillatory brain activity, but it can also be used for event-related fields and multivariate pattern analysis. Specifically, the [pipeline including documented code](https://neuosc.com/flux/) is defined for [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) and [FieldTrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/), and a data set on visuospatial attention is used to illustrate the steps. The scripts are provided as notebooks implemented in Jupyter Notebook and MATLAB Live Editor providing explanations, justifications and graphical outputs for the essential steps. Furthermore, we also provide suggestions for text and parameter settings to be used in registrations and publications to improve replicability and facilitate pre-registrations.
