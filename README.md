### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Centre for Human Brain Health, University of Birmingham (United Kingdom) working in the field of neurophysiology and congnitive neuroscience. I am interested in cognition (e.g., vision, attention, predictions), open science, programming and data science in general. My work makes uses of advances neurophysiological techniques (EEG, MEG, TMS, eye-tracking) and data analysis methods (time-frequency, connectivity, statistics) to better understand how the human brain and mind work.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- the neuronal effect of predictions based on statistical learning on visual attention ([repository](https://github.com/oscfer88/dSL_RIFT))
- COGITATE: an adversarial collaboration on the brain correlates of consciousness ([repository] coming soon)
- FLUX: open-source pipeline for analysing magnetoencephalography (MEG) data ([repository](https://github.com/Neuronal-Oscillations/FLUX))
